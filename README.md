# vip - VERY IMPORTANT PATIENT

This VIP project is a case study to demonstrate advanced skills in Azure, Event hubs, distributed application services, database design, automation of sample dataset in python etc. This is an imaginary project pilot run by an imaginary organization called "Zephyr Health Alliance". It is meant to demonstrate advanced data engineering and cloud application engineering and design skill set. 

Case Study: Optimizing Patient Appointment Reminders at Zephyr Health Alliance

Background

Zephyr Health Alliance is a leading healthcare organization that is committed to providing top-notch healthcare services to its patients. In an effort to enhance patient engagement and improve scheduling efficiency, the organization is planning to conduct a pilot program for a text message appointment reminder campaign. The campaign will target 1,000 Serious and VIP high-risk patients, encouraging them to schedule appointments with their primary care physicians.

Objectives

The primary objectives of the pilot campaign are as follows:

To increase appointment attendance rates among Serious and VIP high-risk patients.
To reduce the influx of calls to the call center for appointment scheduling.
To prioritize patients based on their risk factors, ensuring higher-risk patients receive timely reminders.
Approach

Zephyr Health Alliance plans to execute the pilot campaign over a span of 5 weeks, incorporating a 20% threshold to control the volume of incoming appointments and reduce the load on the call center. The campaign will follow these steps:

Initial Patient List: An initial list of patients, including Serious and VIP high-risk patients, has been pre-defined. This list will serve as the starting point for the campaign.

Risk-Based Priority: Patients will be divided into risk tiers based on predefined risk factors. Higher-risk patients will be given priority in receiving appointment reminders.

Text Message Reminders: Text messages will be sent to the selected patients, encouraging them to schedule appointments with their primary care physicians. The messages will include personalized content to engage patients effectively.

Threshold Implementation: To manage the appointment scheduling influx, a 20% threshold will be implemented. This means that only a portion of eligible patients will receive reminders, gradually increasing the reminder volume over 5 weeks.

Adaptive Priority Logic: Post the 5-week threshold period, priority logic will be adapted to give higher priority to patients with more critical risk factors. This ensures that patients requiring urgent attention are scheduled promptly.

Opt-In/Opt-Out Process: Patient participation in the text message reminder campaign will be managed through a daily file sent by a 3rd party vendor. Patients can opt in or opt out of receiving text messages, and Zephyr Health Alliance will respect their preferences.

Reporting and Evaluation: Throughout the pilot campaign, Zephyr Health Alliance will monitor and collect data on scheduling outcomes, appointment attendance rates, patient engagement, and any operational challenges faced.

Expected Outcomes

The Zephyr Health Alliance team expects several positive outcomes from this pilot campaign:

Improved Patient Engagement: Personalized text message reminders are likely to result in increased patient engagement and higher appointment attendance rates.

Reduced Call Center Traffic: By providing an alternative to phone calls for appointment scheduling, the call center's workload is expected to decrease, leading to improved call response times and customer satisfaction.

Effective Risk-Based Scheduling: The adaptive priority logic will ensure that high-risk patients receive timely care, aligning with the organization's commitment to patient safety.

Enhanced Data Utilization: The campaign's data collection and reporting will provide valuable insights for refining the appointment scheduling process in the future.

Conclusion

Zephyr Health Alliance's innovative approach to using text message reminders for appointment scheduling showcases their dedication to leveraging technology for patient benefit. By gradually implementing a threshold and adapting priority logic, the organization is poised to enhance patient care, optimize resource allocation, and pave the way for more efficient scheduling strategies in the long term.
